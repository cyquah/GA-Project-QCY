      "there is a re-emergence of bubble tea shop lately, which focuses on ‘healthier’ choices such as fruit teas (literally with lots of fruits in it), lesser sugar, and wider range of drinks such as cheese tea. looks like local brand liho, and even gong cha will face stiffer competition – even before the chain reopens at singpost centre later this year. with 2 relatively new outlets at tampines mrt and bedok mall, teafolia has joined in the bubble tea and fruit tea craze.  instead of the usual red, green, black tea leaves from some other parts of taiwan (like most brands claimed), teafolia focuses more on their 700ml fruit tea ($4.80 – $5.90), 500ml stirring milk ($4.50 – $5.50), 500ml smoothies ($4.50- $6.20) and 500ml slushies ($3.90 – $4.80). extra toppings from a selection of pearls, pudding, grass jelly, strawberry konjac, taro, red beans are available at an additional $0.50. the collection of fruit teas on the menu uses either four seasons tea from taiwan, royal ceylon black tea from sri lanka or green tea paired with an assortment of fruits to create the different drinks. my favourite was the signature fruit tea ($5.90) which comes with four seasons tea and fresh pineapple pulp as the base, topped with lime, watermelon, a slice of lemon and green apple. refreshing with a citrusy taste, the signature fruit tea ($5.90) was strong, not that diluted in flavour. for a milder alternative, the strawberry & peach duo ($5.90) came with a royal ceylon black tea with peach sauce, diced peach fruit and strawberries. even though it was not as intense as the signature fruit tea ($5.90), i enjoyed munching on the diced peach which gave the drink additional crunch. using fresh fruits can be a challenge as seasonal fruits will be limited during off-season periods and consistency might be an issue throughout the year. for those seeking a caffeine-free alternative, the 500ml stirring milk can be another option. each cup of stirring milk comes with a sticker to remind us to “stir well” with fresh milk used as its base. recommended drinks from the selection of stirring milk include house favourite stirring milk ($4.50) that comes with pearls, pudding and caramel sauce and taro therapy stirring milk ($5.50) that pairs with generous amount of steamed taro cubes and caramel sauce. the house favourite stirring milk ($4.50) with caramel sauce and pearls does remind us of the bubble tea we had in taiwan for a moment, with soft, chewy and sweetened pearls. perhaps too much caramel sauce is added, the house favourite stirring milk could be a tad sweet. the taro therapy stirring milk ($5.50) suffered the same fate with sweetness overloaded, and i wished that there will be a choice to adjust the level of sweetness in future. i can understand the recent trend in booming numbers of fruit tea shops opening across the island, as they are seemingly healthier compared to the usual bubble tea counterparts. in terms of sugar level and calories, i am really not too sure about that. perhaps hpb can do a more detailed report. hpb, can?  teafolia\n",
