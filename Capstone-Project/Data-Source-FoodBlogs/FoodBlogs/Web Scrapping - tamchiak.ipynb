      "Since I first opened my eyes, and heart, to the world of coffee, I have been going around looking for a good cup of coffee. I am glad to have found my favourite – Kopi More at Golden Mile Food Centre. \n",
      "\n",
      " Meet 43-year-old Lawrence, who used to be a petroleum broker. After leaving the industry, he decided to sell coffee in a hawker centre. “What’s so special about his coffee,” you may ask. Well, he makes traditional Nanyang coffee using an espresso machine! No no, don’t expect Lawrence to make you a cup of latte or flat white. It’s still our kopi-o and kopi siew dai, but done using a modern brewing method. Working in the petroleum industry has definitely helped Lawrence as he has a strong knowledge of water pressure and density. This helped him to calibrate his espresso machine. It also took him months of research to finally find the right blend of Indonesia Robusta and Columbian Arabica beans for his Nanyang coffee. Roasted with sugar and margarine to achieve maximum flavour, the beans are ground upon order and brewed using an espresso machine, instead of a coffee sock. The end result is a well-extracted coffee that is rich and satisfying. He has nailed it! \n",
      " Each cup of hot coffee ($1.50) is full bodied, carries a nutty hint and possesses a mild acidity. Stir it well after the addition of milk and sugar, and you might find yourself falling in love with that smooth and creamy texture. Even though this is a little more pricey than the usual kopi, what you are getting is quality Nanyang coffee. There are even coffee fans who travel all the way here just for this. Thank you Lawrence for bringing good coffee to the heartlands! Address: 505 Beach Road, Golden Mile Food Centre #B1-49, Singapore 199583 Opening Hours: 10am to 10pm daily Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/kopi.more.9\n"
