      "Shin Minori 新稔り(meaning New Harvest) is a Japanese Restaurant popular for its a la carte buffet. Its menu has more than 100 items ranging from sushi and sashimi to teppanyaki and tempura. Shin Minori Katong has just opened in Katong Square. Located on level 2 of Katong Square, Shin Minori Katong has the fairly typical contemporary Japanese izakaya look. It is big and has a variety of seating arrangements. There are private dining rooms available.   Shin Minori Menu offers an extensive range of favourite Japanese dishes and a fair selection of sake, beer and other beverages. The menu in the restaurant is in digital form. A tablet is used to view the menu as well as to order the food. The menu is on their website. They have set lunches and for dinner (and lunch on Sunday and public holiday) there is the popular Shin Minori’s ALA-CARTE Japanese Buffet (Eat-All-You-Can), which is currently priced at S$41.90++. We went to Shin Minori for dinner and ordered a few a la carte items – Katsu Don ($16), Soft Shell Crab Temaki ($5 per roll), Ebi Temoura Temaka ($5 per roll) and Chawanmushi ($7). Hot green tea was charged at $1.80 per person. Service charge and GST would be added to the bill. The food was served very promptly and was quite nicely presented. The Katsu Don came in a big bowl. The pork cutlet simmered with eggs in a soy-based sauce looked nice and was tasty. The portion of rice was larger than usual but alas the quality fell short of the standards of superior quality Japanese rice. The Chawanmushi was topped with 2 good size fresh prawns. The light and delicate Japanese steamed egg custard was flavourful and enjoyable.   Soft Shell Crab Temaki and  Ebi Temoura Temaka came in small individual stands with pickled ginger and a big helping of wasabi. The rice used for the hand rolls seemed to be of better quality and the rice in the Katsu Don. The hand rolls were of the expected standard. At Shin Minori Katong you get an extensive choice of Japanese dishes served to you promptly in a comfortable setting. If you want high quality Japanese food look elsewhere; but if buffet is your thing or you just want a decent Japanese meal at affordable prices than Shin Minori will fit the bill. Ratings:\n",
