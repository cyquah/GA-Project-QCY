      "The jovial ladies over at A Juicery highly recommended their neighbours next door. ”Best pho ever. And you must have their spring rolls.” They also let me know a little secret that the chef behind Pho.Vn used to be from the popular Mr Pho, though this piece of information goes unverified.  Pho.Vn is a fuss-free casual Vietnamese restaurant that specialise both the popular streets food of the Southern and Northern parts of Vietnam. Some of its specialty includes Special Beef Combo Pho ($9.90), Nam Vang Noodle ($9.90), Broken Rice with Pork Chop and Steamed Ham ($8.90), Stir-fry Cockles with garlic ($6.90), and Fried or Fresh Spring Rolls ($3.90). The dessert of Green Bean Paste ($3.90) is also popular, and sometimes sells out early The chef is said to be very particular with the freshness of the ingredient, such that she will go to the market to buy all the fresh beef instead frozen meats from suppliers. All the soup bases are cooked for 6 to 8 hours, with “strictly no MSG added”. For starters, I had the Fresh Spring Rolls ($3.90 for 2 pieces) and Fried Chicken Wings with Fish Sauce ($3.90 for 2 pieces). The former was described by my dining partner as ”very ordinary”, though I enjoyed the freshness and crunch.  The Fried Chicken Wings were calorie-worthy, deliciously marinated and juicy. Borrowing a tagline, those were finger-licking good. As for the greatest surprise, it had to be the Special Beef Combo Pho’s soup ($8.90).  While it looked deceptively light, the savoury broth was packed with flavours and I just couldn’t help slurping spoon by spoon. So good that the sauces seemed unnecessary.  The Pho Noodles used were slippery smooth, fresh-tasting with a good bite.  Prices are considered inexpensive, and I am glad to have found a worthy Pho place with long-simmered tasty soup. Was so off-the-radar, at least till now.  Pho.Vn\n",
