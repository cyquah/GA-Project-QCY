      "DON HO- Social Kitchen & Bar opened earlier this year as the newest kid on the block along Keong Saik road. Sassy and stylish with just a little bit of funk, this tropical-themed restaurant served up Australian-fusion food with a touch of Middle-east in the evenings paired with vibrant eclectic cocktails. Not too long ago however, DON HO also rolled out their Brunch menu which is now available only on weekends. Decidedly modest, the menu features ten dishes which are sufficient for a complete weekend brunch experience, island-style. We started with two smoothies, the Flamingo Paradise $12 for me and Winter is Coming $12 for him (he is an avid Game of Thrones fan you see). The pink one which was mine could not be faulted for it was creamy, sweet and refreshing. Made up of strawberry, mango, banana and coconut milk, you probably can understand why I enjoyed it so much. His on the other hand, was the green one- made up of all things good and detoxifying. Kale, cinnamon, ginger, apricot and almond. Quite peculiar tasting at first but you get used it after a while. Well, he did finish the whole glass, right to the last drop. For the food, we ordered the Slow Cooked Eggs $18 that is sure to win the hearts of vegetarians. Eggs, wild mushrooms atop toasted brioche and a sprinkle of Arugula, what’s not to love? The mushrooms were hearty and perfectly sautéed while the brioche was nicely buttered. This was dressed with red wine sauce for added decadence. Another healthy option was the Hot Smoked Salmon $20 that was served with a decent sized salmon and a generous portion of deep fried potato bites. The orange dressing gave the dish a sweet tangy zest and the runny yolk made it complete. Nothing too spectacular though, we thought this one was less impressive than the previous. For something pretty and dessert-like, the Brioche French Toast $22 with its eye-catching baby-pink raspberry cream cheese ought to do the trick. We had high hopes for this one but unfortunately the best part was probably the bananas that were adequately ripe. Apart from that, the toast was a tad dry, the cream cheese was tart and all the elements did not come together as harmoniously as we had hoped. Nonetheless, DON HO is indeed an interesting addition to the Keong Saik enclave and a great new hangout for after-work drinks. You can also come by for brunch on a lazy Sunday morning and enjoy the different facade the restaurant presents when natural light flows in, and brings out the vivid colour palette and larger-than-life motifs on the walls that make for great backdrops for photographs. 1 Keong Saik Road\n",
