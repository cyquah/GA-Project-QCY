Mido Cafe sits on Temple Street, a very well-known street in Hong Kong infamous for its counterfeit goods and prostitution.We are not fans but we'd go to Temple Street for a taste of Mido Cafe's famous French Toast.

VTartar de Atun Con Ajo Blanco ($12.90): Red tuna tartare with tomato and avocado served with almond soup Generally, there has been a fatigue regarding Spanish tapas in Singapore since its proliferation a few years ago.Only two Spanish restaurants open this year, but what Tapas Club aims to do is to fill the void of Spanish casual dining in Singapore.Usually, the sauce is lightly drizzled, but Tapas Club drowns the potato in spicy brava and alioli sauce: very creamy and delicious.Any Spanish restaurant worth their salt serves good paella, and Tapas Club does good ones.

VWhile many other buffet restaurants out there pride themselves on having the largest and most extensive range of food and cuisines, Window on the Park adopts the 'less is more' approach by dishing out a substantially sized spread of only the good stuff, allowing diners to be able to savour each and every item before their bellies beg them to stop.The evening buffet spread at Window on the Park encompasses the culinary icons from across the region so you can expect to load up on dishes such as chilli crab, fish head curry and roti prata--just to name a few.

VThe combination with cherry tomatoes, avocado and smoked salmon was a good one in my opinion, making it look like a mindful and well balanced meal with essential vitamins and fatty acids of omega 3 and 6.Open Face Toast with Slow Cooked Egg and Grilled Bacon - $15.90 For those not so much a fan of vitamins and fatty acids, an option for you to have pure fats is this one - an open faced toast grilled with tomato slices and cheese (with cheese oozing out and becoming crispy), topped with a ridiculous amount of grilled bacon.It would be better if the croissant was warm and crispy, but I liked the earl grey fragrance from it.

On the menu, you do not get many choices--just a few regular Nippon drinks and sweet treats in the likes of matcha tea, matcha desserts and shiratama zensai (red beans with dumplings).A gorgeous bowl of fruits and jelly, topped with bean jam and served with a cup of tea, this is a simple yet authentic Japanese treat.

The sweetness of the custard has been neutralized by the Thai tea flavour.While it's good news for some, as the Green Tea Pie's sweetness and eggy-ness overshadowed the green tea's natural bitterness, we would have preferred the green tea flavour to be more distinct.Though April's Bakery highly recommend their bestselling pies, the Tokyo Banana Custard Pie, Pumpkin Pie, and Custard Pie won our votes!April Bakery's version of Tokyo Banana Custard Pie is well executed!

Fans of Aglio Olio should not skip Dancing Crab's Seafood Aglio Olio (lunch - S$12, dinner S$15++)--what you get is a plate of warm, buttery pasta with fresh seafood such as prawn, clams, mussels and calamari.

VYear after year, my favourite is still the snowskin mooncakes from Raffles Singapore.Now if have had these Raffles Hotel snowskin mooncakes before, you would know that they are buttery soft.The skin and filling of Raffles Singapore mooncakes are buttery soft while the chocolate truffle is hard.If you do side by side comparison, you will realise that the skin of the Champagne Truffle mooncake is a little softer and bouncier than the coloured ones.Having no colour added (or leaving the colour unevenly marbled) will for sure allow you to have the least kneaded dough and result in softer and better snowskin pastry.

JJ.Com Fish Mart's Tempura Shrimp with Aburi Salmon Maki (S$14.80) was the proud recipient of the SR Signatures award in 2016.A thick slab of smokey melt-in-your-mouth aburi salmon is layered precisely atop the rice filled with crispy and sweet tempura shrimp.  Overall, we can certainly say that JJ.Com Fish Mart is one Japanese eatery that we will be adding to our list of favourite casual Japanese eateries and it is definitely one worth the visit.

VI'm not typically a huge fan of this, but the Custard Bun ($4.20) at Mongkok Dim Sum was a game changer.The crunchiness of the deep-fried crust complemented the smooth yam paste and meat filling well.Biting into the smooth dumpling skin revealed juicy prawns.Another well-executed dim sum they had was their House Special Prawn Dumpling ($4.20).The soft dumpling skin was easy to bite into, while the pork filling was tender and bursting with umami flavour from the broth.It's a bonus that this joint is open all day and all night, which means you can get your dim sum fix even if your cravings strike at an ungodly hour.

VI was particularly excited to try this dish, as I seldom see charcoal siew mai at other dim sum eateries.I say stick to their Steamed Pork & Shrimp Dumpling "Siew Mai" ($3.90+ for three pieces), as the charcoal dumpling skin provides no additional taste or texture.Known in Cantonese as "char siew sou", Baked BBQ Pork Pastry ($4.50+ for three pieces) is a quintessential dim sum item I'd never skip.The lean char siew filling had a great balance between savoury and sweet, and melded into the buttery, flaky pastry with just one bite.

VIf you are looking for a Korean restaurant that specialises in traditional Jeonju Bibimbap, then Gogung in Myeong-dong is where you should be heading to.While toppings on a bibimbap may change according to the season, a classic Jeonju-style Bibimbap usually consists of soybean sprouts, raw egg yolk and beef tartare.  Gogung's Jeonju Dolsot Bibimbap (W11,000) is an aesthetically-pleasing dish served in an earthenware bowl which helps to keep the food warm throughout your meal.Similar to the Jeonju Bibimbap, you also get a generous portion of Korean-style beef tartare, sliced mushrooms, an assortment of colourful vegetables and raw egg.

While prices are not the cheapest in the city, the Korean restaurant is very popular among locals and tourists because of the obvious difference in quality as compared to other KBBQ joints in Seoul.Wangjibip offers free-flow Banchan.The servers at Wangbijib are trained to grill the meat for you so all you have to do is sit back and watch the magic happen.

VWhile we were exploring the quieter side of Gyeongridan in Itaewon, we found the perfect cafe for days when you are just looking to spend your afternoon away from the hubbub of the city.And that cafe is called 'n dear'.As with many cafes in Seoul, n dear provides free wifi and a delectable range of coffee, tea and alcoholic beverages.They also have non-coffee drinks such as Melting Choco (W6,000), Chai Latte (W6,000) and Iced Tea made with real fruits (W6,000).  A delightful drink that would help you cool off from the heat is the Lemon Ginger Ade (W6,500).

VPret A Manger which first opened in London in 1986, is famous for their sandwiches which do not use obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives.The menu at Singapore's Pret a Manger will include the very best of Pret, with customer-favourites from the brand's 30-year history.Those who are, well 'old' enough, would know that Pret A Manger used to have an outlet at Robinson Road about a decade ago.While the branch at Changi Airport will facilitate travelers who need a quick bite, it should be do well in the CBD area, since the 'trend' now is towards healthy, convenient food.Pret A Manger SingaporeChangi Airport Terminal 3, Level 2, Departure Lounge (Central) Transit Area
