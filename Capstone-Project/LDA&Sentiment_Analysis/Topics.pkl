If you are looking for something a little less than usual, flip through the menu of elaborate creations and you will stumble upon something called the Volcanic Avalanche (S$15.80)--which is essentially a raspberry molten lava cake hidden within a volcano of dark chocolate, drizzled with raspberry sauce and surrounded by bits of brownie and crunchy toasted bread sprinkled at the side.  A fairly generous dollop of lime and calamansi ice cream sits atop a hot dog bun and is finished off with a mini key lime cake and a drizzle of a citrusy syrup.

The shophouse premises is long and narrow.We ordered the waffles with a single scoop of honey cinnamon ice cream ($8.50) and a cup of long black ($4) and a cup of chai latte($5).Even though, there are many cafes in the Jalan Besar area, we still think Wimbly Lu Tyrwhitt is a good addition.Singapore Food Blog by Ordinary People looking for Places to Eat Lavender MRT Station (EW11) is a Mass Rapid Transit station on the East West Line.

On the menu, you do not get many choices--just a few regular Nippon drinks and sweet treats in the likes of matcha tea, matcha desserts and shiratama zensai (red beans with dumplings).A gorgeous bowl of fruits and jelly, topped with bean jam and served with a cup of tea, this is a simple yet authentic Japanese treat.

VIt looked, and tasted, very much like the coffeeshop variant you can find at most western food stalls.Thick-cut fries were modestly drizzled with cheese and mayonnaise, and it tasted as basic as it looks.It was a no-frills option served with a buttery croissant, scrambled eggs, and mixed greens.Aside from the misleading preposition in the dish name (scrambled eggs were served beside the croissant, not so much in), this was otherwise a decent dish with hearty portions.We would have liked it better if the eggs came slightly creamier and more custardy.

Vuring the hearts of my fellow Singaporeans, I was more interested in figuring out how to get my hands on the adorable animal donuts that were all the rage in Japan.The images of the animal donuts eventually went viral across the world and I was, of course, nowhere near to trying one.So imagine my surprise when I realised these cat donuts can now be found in our very own Jurong Point.Taste-wise, they are a tad drier than typical chocolate donuts, so don't invest your money in this if you're looking for a good breakfast.

Here's the 'fun' part: While standing in line, you can watch the entire process where the cake is baked freshly in-house.(Unfortunately, the chocolate was not in sight when we visited.)

VAside from their highly acclaimed chicken galbi, Yoogane in Singapore also features a myriad of stellar dishes such as Army Stew, Dosirak, and newly launched Korean-style fried chicken that features three lip-smacking flavours.  New on Yoogane's menu is the Korean fried chicken that comes in 3 different flavours--Galbi, Honey Citron and Bulgogi.  The taste of this everyday Korean comfort food is elevated with the addition of their signature chicken galbi, surrounded by a ring of mouth-watering melted cheese with mushroom and corn which did well to inject an element of crunch and savouriness.

VIt wasn't exactly economical bee hoon for me because he added a lot of toppings for me - chicken wings, cabbage and onion egg.After I moved to my new house, I don't get to eat economical bee hoon much anymore.Just like any other economical bee hoon stall, they serve the usual toppings such as luncheon meat, vegetables, sausages, eggs etc.But one topping that you die die must order is the deep fried chicken chop.The best combo is fried bee hoon, chicken thigh and sambal chilli.

VAfter encountering a stroke previously and faced with his wife's retrenchment, he decided to go back to do what he loved.It was my first time visiting him but it's better late than never.The process of cooking this dish is long and tedious but the rich and bold flavours present make the whole process worthwhile.I like the pork ribs version better than the chicken because it is more flavourful and tender.Address: 505 Beach Road, Golden Mile Food Centre #B1-30, Singapore 199583 Opening Hours: Opening Hours: 11.30am to 7.30pm daily MissTamChiak.com made anonymous visits and paid for its own meals at the stalls featured here.

VHowever, if you're staying in the neighbourhood, you would probably already know about this economical bee hoon stall located at Block 359.So, we made do with their remaining side items, and ordered two plates of bee hoon with sausages, fishcakes, fish fillet, and luncheon meat.The economical bee hoon is prolly one of the best we've tried so far.If you're seated facing the stall, you'll notice a guy constantly bringing out freshly prepared bee hoon in big containers, ensuring that your food is warm.A pity we didn't get to try their chicken wings, but we like the fish fillet and crispy luncheon meat.

VHoe Kee Chicken Rice opens early in the morning and closes just before evening time or when ingredients run out.If you are around Jonker Street, drop by Hoe Kee Chicken Rice for a delightful lunch.An obvious difference between Hoe Kee Chicken Rice and Chop Chung Wah (another famous chicken rice shop at Jonker Street) is the soy sauce drenched all over the chicken.Yes, it is a little more oily because of the sauce but we enjoyed the chicken meat more than the one at Chop Chung Wah. Have it with fragrant chicken rice balls.

VA cursory look at Bee Kia's Instagram geotag suggests that almost every diner here orders their beef hor fun.There's just something more satisfying about eating random fried chicken parts, and that's a real big plus for me.Twice-fried, the chicken was also dusted with breadcrumbs, which helped make the crunch very satisfying.Each half-cooked prawn roll was chopped up, dusted with flour, and quickly fried again so it came to the table piping hot.At times, the hor fun comes packed with flavour and wok hei, and at others, it's just insipid.

VWhere: #01-61, Bendemeer Market & Food Centre ******* Heng Kee Lor Mee Another of my childhood favourite, I like the speedy service of this 'Lor Mee' stall.Where: #01-35, Bendemeer Market & Food Centre ******* Amigo It is not hard to notice a long queue at Amigo which sells minced pork noodles, chicken cutlet 'hor fun' and laksa amongst others.Where: #01-08, Bendemeer Market & Food Centre ******* Toa Payoh Hwa Heng Beef Noodles I randomly chatted with a fellow diner who told me she came all the way from Jurong for this.

VA comfort dish for many Singaporeans, Singaporean Hokkien Mee consists of a mixture of yellow noodles and thin bee hoon, squid, fish cake slices, sliced pork belly and prawns.We ordered the largest plate ($5) to try, and it came with 4 prawns, a portion of squid, sliced pork belly, sliced fishcakes and a generous dollop of sambal chilli on the side.The noodles were fried on the spot with the pre-cooked ingredients being tossed in afterwards, meaning that we did not have to wait for long to enjoy our piping hot plate of Hokkien Mee. We came with high expectations but were rather disappointed as the dish lacked wok hei.

VWe wanted to try the pig's organ soup but the stall obviously has not made the dish available on the day of our visit.The dishes we tried were generally acceptable in term of taste and texture, however, perhaps it is what the standard can go, overall, it would not leave you with too deep the impression.The kway chap's texture was generally smooth, the broth doused with the seasoned braised sauce was light with indistinctive herbal flavour.Of course, it may be not too fair to seal the fate of Ah Kwang Kway Chap with the omission of the key ingredients especially the sinfully fat saturated pig skin and intestine from our tastebuds.

The lady boss manning the stall never failed to keep a smile all the time and her friendliness is simply a pleasant that brightened our day.The dried mee pok was served in a colourful Paranakan bowl, noodle texture was nicely cooked, however, the seasoning sauce especially the chilli was insufficient to heighten the overall flavour.Fishball Minced Meat Noodle The soup is tantalizing and we presumably the soupy version of noodle could be heavenly compared to the dried version which need some extra seasoning for a be

VIt was definitely not the Yong Tau Foo that triumph but the curry or laksa gravy that makes this dish shine; the laksa curry was rich, robust and flavourful with the spiciness that was fairly tolerable, for more kicks to the spiciness, you can always add the chilli paste from the self-service counter to perk up the overall spicy level.Fried Chicken cutlet Noodle  Rice $4  $5 This is another signature dish here, the noodle was doused with the same laksa curry gravy and topped with fried chicken cutlet, the chicken cutlet was freshly fried to retain the crispiness, the meat was tender but it was the well-marinated chicken that helped to elevate the overall taste of the cutlet, hints of fermented beancurd flavour greatly enhanced the taste.
